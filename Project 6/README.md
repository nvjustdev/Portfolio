# Project Overview

The project showcases testing of web projects using Jasmine. In this project, we will be testing the feed web page of Udacity.

The actual web page with the test cases can be accessed at http://nvjustdev.github.io/portfolio/Project%206/


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.


## What did I learn?

I learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation. I also learned to write test cases for features that were coming in the future.
