## Why this Project?

This project demonstrates my ability to understand, translate specification into applications that are easy to use.

##How this app works?
- The app requests information from Google maps, GreatSchools, and Yelp to put together the list of schools segregated into type of schools
- The page requests information from the Data sources asynchronously
- The app also keeps the user updated using a simple progress bar
- List View: A list of schools are shown in the side. Each name is clickable to reveal the appropriate marker.
- Search: A search bar to search for a type of school (for example, Elementary) is provided and the search bar allows for autocompletion
- There's also a button to see all the schools colored per the type (along with a legend showing the colors)
- When a marker is clicked, the following information are obtained: School rating from GreatSchools, Rating from Yelp, and a link to the Yelp review (if available).

##Future features
- Ability to enter a new zipcode and get the information
- Ability to zoom to the marker appropriately
- Connect with more APIs that offer information about schools
